ooyala-api-client
=================

A PHP library for Ooyala REST APIs

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sheknows/ooyala-api-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sheknows/ooyala-api-client)

Development
-----------
The Ooyala client API uses composer to manage dependencies.
Included are a couple convenience Rake tasks for getting/running composer:

Install composer dependencies + dev dependencies:

```sh
rake composer:dev
```

Install required dependencies:

```sh
rake composer:install
```

_Note: Running Rake composer tasks requires curl_

Testing
-------
The library testing suite contains mocked response objects and some core tests against the live Ooyala API.

Run offline tests tests:

```shell
rake test:offline
```

Run live tests against the Ooyala API:

```shell
rake test:internet
```

Run the entire test suite:

```shell
rake test
```

Travis CI
---------
Tests use Travis [secure environment variables](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Secure-environment-variables). Forks testing this branch will need to generate environment variables to use Travis:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec travis encrypt MY_VAR=my-secret
```

_Note: encrypted ENV variables for this project will not work correctly on a fork. See the build configuration guide for more info._

Documentation
-------------
API documentation is available at [http://sheknows.github.com/ooyala-api-client/](http://sheknows.github.com/ooyala-api-client/). To build the documentation:
